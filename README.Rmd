The package contains code that handles some particular external PDE solvers.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("maciejsmolka/solvergater.solvers")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to run an MT solver:

```{r mt}
# library(solvergater.solvers)
# library(solvergater)
# mts <- mt_solver()
# compute_objective(mts, c(1, 2, 3, 10), 70)
```
